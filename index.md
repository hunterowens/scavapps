*   Justin “Knight of the Techb@r, ex patriot of Tufts house, Nicholas Page to the stars, time cop, defender of all things timed, keeper of a record of temporal events, sexy librarian and record keeper of the secret and esteemed society of followers of the ancient tradition of far east digital media, once and future king of Colorado, connoisseur of all things digital and entertaining, PAX Prime champion, honorary asian, looking for more obscure nicknames, wondering how many more descriptors he can come up with, running out of ideas for middle names, I think I’ve finally reached the end” Lang.

* I’m here for one simple reason. To kick ass, and check bubble gum, and I’m all out of bubblegum. This is BroStoMP’s third year, and I want to help make sure we keep pushing on strong. BroStoMP has a lot of different houses in a lot of different places, and I want to keep that house representation strong. Talking to RHs about setting up house representatives, holding scav study breaks to get our presence known in the houses again, and selling as many god damn donuts as is physically possible. Finally, more than anything, I went to help contribute to the existence of a long-standing team, one that has always been a home for me come scav time, and I hope can continue to be a home for all the disparate teams that compose it in the future.

*  There was a point in history when UChicago was a strong member of the Big 10 conference, but due to a de-emphasis on varsity sports, and a string of less than stellar performances, they decided to leave the conference. It seemed that they were doomed to forever be a Division III team, never living up to their once illustrious status. However, the time has finally come for UChicago to reclaim their rightful spot. Buried deep within the abandoned steam tunnels underneath the school, a group of urban explorers discovered the frozen bodies of UChicago’s original Big 10 team. Through the miracles of modern technology, their minds and bodies were reconstituted with the sole intent of once again being the kings of the Big 10, now Big 11 conference. Coming this summer, starring Zac Efron as the cute but clueless football star, with co-star Anne Hathaway playing the quiet scientist, thrust unexpectedly into a vicious love triangle between her then boyfriend(played by Taylor Lautner) and the newly revived star quarterback for UChicago, is the biggest movie to hit box offices since Gone Girl and The Lego Movie. Critics are raving that A Yard Too Far is a beautiful but tragic story of one schools return to power, a story that is sure to touch the hearts of millions.

* This week on Iron Chef, we’ll see what comes to a boil when Ryne Weiss and Reem Elorbany take on Iron Chef Masaharu Morimoto in a battle for the ages. Reem and Ryne have been training for decades for just such a match, and today we will see whose cuisine reigns supreme. Ryne and Reem come together today reuniting an old partnership, and just for this meeting, we’ve prepared a very special secret ingredient. This week’s secret ingredient is…… Donuts! Tune in after this commercial break to see what delicious concoctions these two teams will create.
 
And we’re back. Let’s take a look at what’s cooking on the Iron Chef’s side.  It seems Morimoto has begun piecing together his Donut sushi, as well as firing up the ice cream machine for his patented donut ice cream. Now let’s take a look at the challengers side. The challengers aren’t anywhere to be seen, but it seems they’ve already finished laying out their dishes. Donut sandwiches with fries and fried chicken filling, mashed donuts, donuts served straight from the box(Who can argue with a classic?), a delicious donut glaze, and to top it all off, three mighty towers of donuts, reminiscent of a croquembouche, entitled the Pierce Towers of Hanoi.
